# MERICA-CAWW
<h1>Website for my Country</h1>
<p>My project provides some bakcground on the key aspects of America and is called, "Merica-caww". I made this project for the Boba Olympics YSWS which ended early February 2026. I made my project with html, css, js, and waveform api for the music feature at the bottom. I struggled with the css formating for the fonts and positioning in the site and I learned how to differenciate background images with background colors and how to make a color-changing background.</p>
