        <img src="Football commies.jpeg" id="commies">
        <p>American football is a huge thing in the United States. It involves tackling, headbutting ~you shouldnt rlly but people do~ and running. Football requires a lot of energy, muscle mass, and teamwork. Some of the best players are <bold>Tom Brady and Jerry Rice.</bold> Sunday night football is a big thing here!</p>
        <img src="FutbolMessi.jpeg" id="messi">
        <p>Futból ~also known as soccer~ is a well known sport throughout the world. Lionel Messi works for Inter Miami as one of the top 100 known soccer players in the world!!</p>

        <h2>AMERICA- The Melting Pot 😎</h2>
        <img src="Melting Pot.jpeg" id="mix">
        <p>America is known as the <bold>-melting pot-</bold> because of its diverse culture. This is a metaphor representing the assimilation of immigrants from diverse backgrounds into a single, cohesive, and modernized American culture. This may be an insult to American culture because it allegedly blends various cultural traditions into one big melting pot. However, Americas diverse culture is beautiful and to be appreciated!</p>
